I completed my PhD in the [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://ee.iisc.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}, [Indian Institute of Science](https://iisc.ac.in/), Bengaluru. I was working at the [Computer Vision Laboratory](https://ee.iisc.ac.in/cvlab/), headed by Prof [Venu Madhav Govindu](https://ee.iisc.ac.in/~venu/), where my research was supported by [Prime Minister's Research Fellowship](https://www.pmrf.in/).

My current research interests are in 3D computer vision. My recent work mostly focused on estimating camera motions in 3D reconstruction problems like structure-from-motion and simultaneous-localization-and-mapping.

Previously, I spent about two years working on impulse noise removal from colour images during my undergraduate days. I like volunteering and organising events. I enjoy listening to music in free time.
