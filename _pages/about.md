I am a postdoc at [Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs](https://merl.com/), looking at 3D reconstruction problems in computer vision. Previously, I completed my PhD from the [Indian Institute of Science](https://iisc.ac.in/) where I worked at the [Computer Vision Laboratory](https://ee.iisc.ac.in/cvlab/), headed by Prof [Venu Madhav Govindu](https://ee.iisc.ac.in/~venu/). My research in PhD was supported by a [Prime Minister's Research Fellowship](https://www.pmrf.in/).

<!--
My research interests are broadly in 3D reconstruction problems in computer vision. My recent works focus on estimating camera motions in 3D reconstruction problems like structure-from-motion and simultaneous-localization-and-mapping.
-->
During my undergraduate days, I spent about two years working on impulse noise removal from colour images. I like volunteering and organising events. I enjoy listening to music in free time.
