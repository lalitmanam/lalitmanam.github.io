I am Ph.D. student in the [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://ee.iisc.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}, [Indian Institute of Science](https://iisc.ac.in/), Bengaluru. I am working at Computer Vision Laboratory, headed by Prof [Venu Madhav Govindu](https://ee.iisc.ac.in/venu-madhav-govindu/). Currently, I am looking into problems in 3D Vision, primarily on structure-from-motion and SLAM pipelines.

Previously, I worked on impulse noise removal from colour images. I like volunteering and organising events. I enjoy listening to music in free time.
