Research Interests
------
I am currently interested in 3D Vision problems primarily on large scale structure-from-motion and SLAM pipelines. Previously, I was involved in development of impulse noise removal techniques from colour images.

Current Research
------
My current work focuses on 3D reconstruction problems which means to build a 3D representation of a scene. This requires estimating the locations of the cameras, where cameras would have been during image acquisition.
